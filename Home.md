Okay, now you want to build one?  First, check out the instructable: http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-the-Raibow-PHiZZ-Origami-Buckyball/.

That will get you started.  Now you want to generate one for your own size project?  Maybe the giant one?

Well check out the code here under 'Source', make sure you have python with cairo extensions installed, and that you have graphviz installed.  Then you simply run the script called... you guessed it... 'RUN'.
